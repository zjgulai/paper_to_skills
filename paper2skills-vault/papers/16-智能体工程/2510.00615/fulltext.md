###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (Acon), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. Acon leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that Acon reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have become the backbone of AI agents across diverse real-world tasks, leveraging language knowledge and reasoning to plan, act, and adapt in dynamic environments (Yao et al., 2023). These tasks often unfold over extended horizons: the agent must gather information, invoke tools, and revise plans based on feedback. In such settings, context is not auxiliary but foundational, as tool APIs and data formats lack standardization (Anthropic, 2024a), and even personalized environments differ in file structures or account data. Agents must therefore accumulate and maintain records of prior actions, observations, and world state. Losing this information, such as an email identifier, file version, or API format, can derail task success.

*Figure 1: Accuracy–Peak tokens trade-off on AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024). We compare average accuracy versus peak input tokens in history compression. Acon (ours) reduces cost while preserving accuracy for the large model (gpt-4.1) relative to a naive prompting baseline, and even improves accuracy on smaller models (gpt-4.1-mini and Qwen-14B). More results are in Section 4.*

The centrality of context, however, makes it a bottleneck. As interactions accumulate, contexts grow unbounded as in Figure 2, creating two major challenges. First, the inference cost of transformers scales with the context length, which becomes prohibitive in long-horizon tasks. Second, excessively long contexts dilute relevant information, distracting the model with outdated or extraneous details (Shi et al., 2023). These issues make effective context management and compression indispensable. Existing compression approaches only partially address this need. Dialogue-oriented systems rely on session-level summarization or tiered memories suitable for conversational coherence but inadequate for multi-step carry-over (Packer et al., 2023). Document-centric methods in long-context QA or in-context learning (Li et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024) assume single-step reasoning where context can be discarded after producing an answer. While effective in their domains, these strategies fall short for complex multi-step tasks where success depends on retaining structured signals across many interactions.

*Figure 2: Motivation: Unbounded context in LLM agents. As LLM agents interact with environments, actions and observations continuously accumulate, leading to ever-growing contexts that incur high memory usage as in the red line on the right plot. This motivates Agent Context Optimization (Acon), which optimally compresses histories and observations into concise summaries, reducing peak tokens and memory as in the blue line on the right plot.*

The challenge becomes particularly critical in productivity scenarios (e.g., email management, document processing, or workflow automation) where agents must coordinate across heterogeneous tools and maintain precise state information. Unlike simpler agent tasks, these environments demand preservation of diverse signal types: factual history, action–outcome relationships, evolving environment states, success preconditions, and future decision cues. Naive strategies like token truncation or generic summarization easily lose critical details essential for long-horizon reasoning. Recent agent-focused compression methods (Deng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025; Smith, 2025) either specialize narrowly or rely on brittle heuristics, limiting their applicability across the full spectrum of multi-step agent tasks.

We address these challenges with Agent Context Optimization (Acon), a unified framework for systematic and adaptive context compression. Our study yields three key findings. First, task- and environment-specific guidelines enable consistent context compression across diverse agents without sacrificing performance. Second, optimized contexts not only reduce costs but also improve decision quality, allowing smaller LLMs to act more effectively. Third, high-quality compressors can be distilled into even smaller models, reducing overhead and improving deployability.

Acon dynamically condenses environment observations and interaction histories into concise, informative representations. Rather than handcrafting prompts, we introduce a guideline optimization pipeline that refines compressor prompts via failure analysis in natural language space (Pryzant et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2024; Yüksekgönül et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025), ensuring that critical environment-specific and task-relevant information is retained. Importantly, Acon is gradient-free, requiring no parameter updates, making it directly usable with closed-source or production models. We further distill optimized compressors into smaller models for cost-efficient deployment.

We validate Acon on three multi-step agent benchmarks: AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024), OfficeBench (Wang et al., 2024b), and Multi-objective QA (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2025), each requiring 15+ interaction steps. Our empirical results demonstrate clear advantages of Acon: (i) lowers memory usage by 26–54% (peak tokens) while largely maintaining task performance; (ii) enables effective distillation of the context compressor into smaller models, preserving 95% of the teacher’s accuracy across all benchmarks, thereby reducing the overhead of the additional module; (iii) allows small LMs to function more effectively as agents, improving performance by 32% on AppWorld, 20% on OfficeBench, and 46% on Multi-objective QA by mitigating the distraction of long contexts through Acon. Our result highlights on AppWorld benchmark are in Figure 1.

To summarize, our work makes the following contributions:

-

We propose Agent Context Optimization (Acon), a framework for compressing both environment observations and interaction histories, tailored to multi-step, long-horizon agentic tasks.

-

We develop a failure-driven, task-aware compression guideline optimization. Our approach is entirely gradient-free and readily applicable to any LLMs, including API-based models.

-

We provide a cost-efficient solution by distilling optimized compressors into smaller models, preserving over 95% of the teacher’s performance while reducing module overhead.

-

We validate Acon on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA, showing that it reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while preserving task success with large LLMs, and enabling small LMs to achieve 20-46% performance improvements.

## 2 Related Works

#### Long-horizon LLM agents.

Large language model (LLM) agents extend pretrained models beyond static single-step reasoning tasks (e.g., RAG-based QA, math problem solving, or code generation) to interactive decision-making in dynamic environments (Yao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Team et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025a). Unlike chatbots or solvers that return an answer in one pass, agents must iteratively observe their surroundings, select tools, and execute actions while revising their plans based on feedback (Shridhar et al., 2021; Jimenez et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Bonatti et al., 2024). Recent work highlights the importance of long-horizon LLM agents, which tackle tasks that unfold over dozens to hundreds of steps and require coordination across multiple applications and tools (Kwa et al., 2025; Trivedi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2025b). A central challenge in these scenarios lies in managing the dynamic long context, where the agent must retain multi-step interaction histories and handle diverse observations produced by heterogeneous environments.

#### Context compression for LLMs.

Managing this ever-growing context has been a longstanding challenge, and a variety of approaches have been proposed to compress LLM inputs. Prior works on context compression can be broadly grouped into three directions: document- or retrieval-based compression (Seo et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Yoon et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2024; Shandilya et al., 2025), dialogue memory summarization (Xu et al., 2025; Maharana et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a), and low-level KV cache compression (Zhang et al., 2025). While each line of research has demonstrated benefits in its respective setting, they remain insufficient for the dynamic and heterogeneous contexts required by long-horizon agents.

Beyond these directions, a few recent studies have attempted to compress context specifically for LLM agents (Deng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025; Smith, 2025; Yang et al., 2024b). However, these approaches either rely on naive prompting or target narrow domains such as the accessibility tree in web browsing, limiting their generality. In contrast, our work introduces a universal agent context optimization framework that is applicable to arbitrary agents. It supports both history and observation compression, and incorporates a generalizable optimization methodology that is agnostic to the underlying model, making it applicable to both open-source and proprietary API-based LLMs.

## 3 Agent Context Optimization (Acon)

We present Agent Context Optimization (Acon), a unified framework for optimized history and observation compression in long-horizon LLM agents. We begin by formulating the agent task and defining context cost in Section 3.1. Next, in Section 3.2, we introduce generative compression with LLMs for both history and observation, and formalize the associated optimization objective and its challenges. We then propose our optimization method in Section 3.3, followed by a distillation that enables smaller models for compressions to improve efficiency (Section 3.4).

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

#### Task.

An agentic task is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) ${\mathcal{E}}=\left\langle{\mathcal{S}},{\mathcal{A}},{\mathcal{O}},{\mathcal{T}},{\mathcal{R}}\right\rangle$ with state space ${\mathcal{S}}$, action space ${\mathcal{A}}$, and observation space ${\mathcal{O}}$. The transition function ${\mathcal{T}}(s,a)\rightarrow(s^{\prime},o)$ is deterministic, and it is determined by the implementation of the environment. Specifically, it executes an action $a\in{\mathcal{A}}$ in the environment and returns the next state and observation. The reward function ${\mathcal{R}}$ returns the reward given the terminal state $s_{T}$. The terminal state is arrived when the transition function receives the special action (e.g., finish_task).

An LLM agent interacts with the environment to get information for making a decision to achieve a given task $o_{0}$ through multiple steps. For each step $t$, the LLM ${\mathcal{M}}$ generates the action $a_{t}$ followed by its reasoning at each step (Yao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a) given the interaction history ${\bm{h}}_{t-1}=(o_{0},a_{0},o_{1},a_{1},\cdots,o_{t-1},a_{t-1})$ and the latest observation $o_{t}$:

${\mathcal{M}}(o_{t},{\bm{h}}_{t-1};\theta,{\mathcal{P}}_{\sf agent})\mapsto a_{t},$ | | | | (1) |

where $\theta$ refers to the pre-trained parameters of the LLM and ${\mathcal{P}}_{\sf agent}$ is the prompt that consists of a general environment description, tools, output format, and few-shot examples in natural language.

#### Cost function for context.

We assume that the LLM agent’s parameters $\theta$ and the task and system prompt ${\mathcal{P}}_{\sf agent}$ are fixed. We define a cost function ${\mathcal{C}}$ that measures the cost of encoding the dynamic context during action generation at each step such as ${\mathcal{O}}(n)$ computational cost of a transformer for decoding given $n$ input tokens. The cost function takes the interaction history ${\bm{h}}_{t-1}$, and the latest observation $o_{t}$ as input and returns the per-step cost:

$C({\bm{H}})=\sum\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}{\mathcal{C}}({\bm{h}}_{t-1},o_{t}),$ | | | | (2) |

where $C$ is the total cost of completing the task, ${\bm{H}}=\{{\bm{h}}_{t-1},o_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T}$ denotes the sequence of history and observation of each step. Typically, $C$ is proportional to the summation of token lengths of action and observations in each step, ${\bm{h}}_{t-1}$ and $o_{t}$. While the prompt cost is static and can be budgeted in advance, the costs from interaction histories are unbounded, leaving the user with only two options: terminate the task early or truncate the context heuristically to a maximum length. This raises the central question: how can we compress context more effectively than such heuristics?

### 3.2 History & Observation Compression with LLMs

To address this challenge, we use an LLM $f(\cdot;\phi,{\mathcal{P}})$, parameterized by pre-trained weights $\phi$ and a compression guideline ${\mathcal{P}}$, to minimize context cost defined in Equation 2 (e.g., summarize the given interaction history). As in Equation 1, the LLM receives two inputs at each step: the interaction history ${\bm{h}}_{t-1}$ and the latest observation $o_{t}$. This introduces two options for context compression:

#### History compression.

The interaction history accumulates both environment observations and agent actions. In long-horizon tasks, this history can grow excessively large. To manage its length, we apply history compression only when the history length exceeds a predefined threshold $T_{\sf hist}$:

${\bm{h}}_{t}^{\prime}=f({\bm{h}}_{t};\phi,{\mathcal{P}}_{\sf hist})\;\;\text{if }|{\bm{h}}_{t}|>T_{\sf hist},\quad{\bm{h}}_{t}\;\;\text{otherwise}.$ | | | | (3) |

The compressed history ${\bm{h}}_{t}^{\prime}$ replaces the raw history in Equation 1. This selective compression ensures that the overhead of invoking the compressor is incurred only when necessary (Smith, 2025).

#### Latest observation compression.

Given an action $a$, the environment returns an observation $o$ according to the transition function $\mathcal{T}(s,a)\rightarrow(s^{\prime},o)$. We similarly apply observation compression only when the observation length exceeds a threshold $T_{\sf obs}$:

$o_{t}^{\prime}=f(o_{t},{\bm{h}}_{t-1};\phi,{\mathcal{P}}_{\sf obs})\;\;\text{if }|o_{t}|>T_{\sf obs},\quad o_{t}\;\;\text{otherwise}.$ | | | | (4) |

This mechanism avoids unnecessary overhead when $o_{t}$ is already short, while still reducing redundant or distracting content in long observations (Xu et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025). The compressed one $o_{t}^{\prime}$ replaces the raw one in Equation 1 and is stored in the interaction history ${\bm{h}}$.

In both cases, the compressor LLM selects information to preserve based on its learned prior knowledge of importance. However, there is no guarantee that the salient details required for successful task completion are retained. The agent context effectively serves as a world model of the environment, encompassing diverse forms of information such as causal relations (e.g., email leaves drafts), evolving states (e.g., account balance), preconditions (e.g., login required), and task-relevant decision cues (e.g., due dates). Effective context compression must therefore accommodate this heterogeneous and dynamic nature of agent context, ensuring that the most critical signals are preserved for long-horizon reasoning and task success.

#### Optimization objective.

We optimize the compressor parameters $\psi\triangleq(\phi,{\mathcal{P}})$ to maximize task reward while minimizing context cost. At each step $t$, the compressor produces either a compressed history ${\bm{h}}_{t}^{\prime}=f_{\sf hist}({\bm{h}}_{t};\psi)$ or observation $o_{t}^{\prime}=f_{\sf obs}(o_{t},{\bm{h}}_{t-1};\psi)$. Let the compressed context be

${\bm{H}}^{\prime}(\psi)\;=\;\{\,{\bm{h}}_{t-1}^{\prime},\,o_{t}^{\prime}\,\}_{t=1}^{T},\qquad C({\bm{H}}^{\prime}(\psi))\;=\;\sum\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}{\mathcal{C}}({\bm{h}}_{t-1}^{\prime},o_{t}^{\prime}).$ | | | | (5) |

With the agent ${\mathcal{M}}(\cdot;\theta,{\mathcal{P}}_{\sf agent})$ fixed, the environment induces a trajectory $\tau(\psi)$ and terminal state $s_{T}(\psi)$ when the agent conditions on ${\bm{H}}^{\prime}(\psi)$. Our learning objective is

$\max_{\psi}\;\underbrace{\mathbb{E}\!\left[\,{\mathcal{R}}\!\big(s_{T}(\psi)\big)\,\right]}_{\text{maximize}}\;-\;\lambda\,\underbrace{\mathbb{E}\!\left[\,C\!\big({\bm{H}}^{\prime}(\psi)\big)\,\right]}_{\text{minimize}},\qquad\lambda\geq 0,$ | | | | (6) |

where $\lambda$ is a multiplier and the expectations are over tasks.

#### Challenges.

The optimization objective in Equation 6 is difficult to optimize in practice because there is no gold supervision for compression, the reward is sparse and only revealed at the end of the trajectory, and the context cost is defined over discrete quantities, which precludes direct gradient computation. While these properties naturally motivate reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018), applying RL to this setting introduces additional obstacles: (1) updating the parameters $\phi$ of a LLM with RL can be computationally prohibitive, (2) environment roll-outs are extremely expensive since each reward requires multi-step executions of both agent and compressor LLMs, and (3) policy gradient estimates suffer from high variance because compression quality is only indirectly evaluated through eventual task success.

*Figure 3: Compression Guideline Optimization. Feedback is generated by contrasting successful trajectories (no compression) with failed ones (with compression). The collected feedback is then used by LLM to refine the compression guidelines.*

### 3.3 Optimizing Compression Guidelines

To overcome these challenges, we propose to optimize compression guidelines ${\mathcal{P}}$ (natural language prompts) for context compression, rather than fine-tuning model parameters $\phi$. Trajectories under compressed contexts provide dense signals about the quality of compression. For example, if the agent fails with compressed context while succeeding without compression, this indicates that the compressed context may have lost crucial information. Such trajectory-level comparisons yield richer feedback than scalar rewards (e.g., binary task success).

We instantiate this idea as prompt optimization using an LLM as the optimizer, where the natural language prompt ${\mathcal{P}}$ is refined via feedback expressed in natural language (Yang et al., 2024a; Yüksekgönül et al., 2025; Khattab et al., 2024). We introduce compression guideline optimization based on contrastive task feedback.

On the training set ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf train}$, we run the LLM agent both without and with context compression to obtain baseline context ${\bm{H}}$ and compressed context ${\bm{H}}^{\prime}$. We collect tasks where the agent succeeds with ${\bm{H}}$ but fails with ${\bm{H}}^{\prime}$, forming a contrastive subset ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf cont}$. For each task in ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf cont}$, we query a optimizer LLM with the context before and after compression to obtain natural language feedback:

$\displaystyle\text{Feedback}=\text{LLM}(\text{Feedback Instruction},{\bm{H}},{\bm{H}}^{\prime}).$ | | | | (7) |

This feedback serves as a natural language gradient (Yüksekgönül et al., 2025), indicating how the compression guideline ${\mathcal{P}}$ should be refined. We then aggregate feedback from multiple trajectories:

$\displaystyle{\mathcal{P}}^{(1)}=\text{LLM}(\text{Update Instruction},{\mathcal{P}}^{(0)},\textstyle\|_{i=1}^{n}\text{Feedback}_{i}),$ | | | | (8) |

where $\|$ is concatenation of feedbacks from each task, which corresponds to a batch optimization step in textual gradient descent (Yüksekgönül et al., 2025). We also generate multiple candidate prompts $\{{\mathcal{P}}_{k}^{(1)}\}$, evaluate them on ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf cont}$, and select the best-performing one. We refer this process as utility maximization step $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ as it primarily maximizes the first term (task reward) of Equation 6.

However, optimizing only for reward may neglect the context cost (second term in Equation 6). To address this, motivated by alternating optimization, we perform a second iteration that conditions only on successful task with compressed context, asking the LLM to generate feedback about which information was actually used during execution. This refines ${\mathcal{P}}^{(1)}\rightarrow{\mathcal{P}}^{(2)}$, encouraging shorter yet sufficient contexts. We refer this additional process as compression maximization step $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ as it minimizes the second term (context cost) of Equation 6.

We illustrate overall process in Figure 3. Algorithm 1 and prompts are in Appendix B.

### 3.4 Distilling Context Compression into Small Models

While compression guideline optimization enables effective compression, repeatedly invoking the large LLM for compression adds substantial overhead. To reduce this cost, we distill the compressor into a smaller model. The teacher with optimized guideline ${\mathcal{P}}^{*}$ (parameters $\phi_{\sf T}$) generates compressed outputs ${\bm{y}}$ from input ${\bm{x}}$, which supervise the student (parameters $\phi_{\sf S}$). We train the student with a cross-entropy objective (Kim & Rush, 2016) with input-output pair $({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}})$, where $({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}})=({\bm{h}}_{t},{\bm{h}}_{t}^{\prime})$ for Equation 3 or $({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}})=(({\bm{h}}_{t-1},o_{t}),o_{t}^{\prime})$ for Equation 4:

$\min_{\phi_{\sf S}}\;\mathbb{E}_{({\bm{x}},{\bm{y}})\sim\mathcal{D}^{+}_{\sf train}}\Bigg[-\sum_{n=1}^{L_{\bm{y}}}\log f({\bm{y}}_{n}\mid{\bm{x}},{\bm{y}}_{<n};\phi_{\sf S},{\mathcal{P}}^{*})\Bigg],$ | | | | (9) |

where $\mathcal{D}^{+}_{\sf train}$ denotes tasks where the teacher succeeds with compressed context.

Once trained, the student replaces the teacher during inference, decoupling decision making from compression. This two-stage pipeline, guideline optimization then distillation, achieves effective compression with a much smaller model ($|\phi_{\sf T}|\gg|\phi_{\sf S}|$):

$f(\cdot;\phi_{\sf T},{\mathcal{P}})\xrightarrow{\;\text{prompt optimization}\;}f(\cdot;\phi_{\sf T},{\mathcal{P}}^{*})\xrightarrow{\;\text{distillation}\;}f(\cdot;\phi_{\sf S},{\mathcal{P}}^{*}).$ | | | | (10) |

## 4 Experiments

We evaluate Acon on three challenging benchmarks that require multi-step interactions across diverse domains. Our experiments are designed to address the following key questions:

-

How well does Acon improve token efficiency while preserving performance? (Section 4.2)

-

Does distilling the compressor reduce its size while maintaining agent performance? (Section 4.3)

-

Can Acon help small, distilled LM agents perform better under long contexts? (Section 4.4)

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

#### Benchmarks & Metrics.

We focus on long-horizon agentic task benchmarks that require $10+$ interaction steps on average: (1) AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024): Main benchmark with 9 simulated apps (e.g., Venmo, Spotify, SimpleNote) and $\sim$100 simulated users. Performance is measured by task completion score. (2) OfficeBench (Wang et al., 2024b): Productivity tasks across 6 apps (e.g., Word, Excel, Email), operating on simulated documents. Performance is measured by benchmark-defined accuracy functions. (3) 8-objective QA (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2025): QA benchmark where agents interact with a search tool to answer 8 questions and output a consolidated answer set. Performance is the average of Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores across 8 questions.

In addition to task-specific performance metrics, we report three token efficiency metrics following prior work (Zhang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025): (1) Steps: The average number of interaction steps per task. (2) Peak Tokens: The maximum context length encountered across all steps. (3) Dependency: The cumulative dependency of each generated action on prior tokens, measuring how much generation relies on the context history. Full details are provided in the Appendix B.

#### Baselines.

(1) No Compression: full uncompressed context. (2) FIFO: keep the most recent $k$ interactions, discarding earlier ones (Yang et al., 2024b). (3) Retrieval: select $k$ past interactions most similar to the current query via embedding search (Xu et al., 2025). (4) LLMLingua: extractive compression with an encoder-only LM (Jiang et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2024). (5) Prompting: naive baseline using a general compression instruction (Smith, 2025; Lee et al., 2025).

#### Our Methods.

We evaluate two versions of Acon. (1) Acon $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ utilizes an optimized guideline for context compression after utility maximization step. (2) Acon $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ applies compression maximization step $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ after utility maximization $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$, aiming for shorter but informative compression.

Each block reports accuracy (task goal completion score), steps, peak input tokens ($10^{3}$), and dependency ($10^{6}$) for agents. Best results in each column are highlighted in bold. Rows in blue background indicate the results from ours. Acon consistently improves accuracy while reducing peak tokens and dependency, with Acon $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ achieving the best overall performance.*

### 4.2 Overall performance and token efficiency on LLMs

In Table 1 and Table 2, we first evaluate Acon using on gpt-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025b) for both agent and compressor, which already achieves strong results on three long-horizon benchmarks.

For history compression, as shown in Table 1, on AppWorld, Acon reduces peak tokens by over 25% while preserving the accuracy of the no compression upper bound, outperforming all baselines that suffer severe degradation on medium and hard tasks spanning longer steps. On OfficeBench (2(a)), Acon lowers peak context size by nearly 30% while maintaining accuracy above 74%. On 8-objective QA (2(b)), Acon even surpasses the no compression baseline in EM/F1 while reducing peak tokens and dependency by 54.5% and 61.5%, respectively. For observation compression, Acon consistently outperforms all baselines confirming that compression guideline optimization is effective for compressing not only history but also raw observations.

Applying only the utility maximization step ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$) improves performance while reducing token cost across all benchmarks, whereas the compression maximization step ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$) further lowers token cost but may slightly hurt accuracy, except in AppWorld where it even yields additional gains.

*Figure 4: Results of distilled compressors on history compression with gpt-4.1 as the agent. Student models (Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-8B, Phi-4) are distilled from gpt-4.1 compressor using the optimized compression guideline after $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ step, and evaluated across all benchmarks. We also include result with gpt-4.1-mini without distillation for comparison.*

### 4.3 Compressor Distillation

We distill the compressor with optimized guidelines after $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ step into smaller models such as Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-8B (Yang et al., 2025), and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024) using LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). As shown in Figure 4, distilled compressors retain over 95% of the performance of gpt-4.1 compressor while reducing overhead. We also find that gpt-4.1-mini, even without distillation, can serve as a lightweight compressor in OfficeBench and QA. These results confirm that small models are sufficient for compression, enabling the expensive LLM to be only reserved for the agent.

*Figure 5: Performance-efficiency trade-off of the Qwen3-14B agent distilled from gpt-4.1 trajectories. For distilled compressors, we use the same distillation setting as in Figure 4. Compared to the baseline without compression, our framework Acon provides compressed trajectories combined with a distilled compressor, enabling the distilled agent to achieve consistently higher accuracy while requiring substantially fewer peak input tokens across all benchmarks. *

### 4.4 Acon for distilled small agents

We examine whether Acon also benefits smaller LLM agents, which are particularly vulnerable to long-horizon inefficiency. Without compression, models such as Qwen3-14B often fail on medium and hard tasks due to distracting context. As shown in Figure 5, Acon substantially improves their performance: on AppWorld, Qwen3-14B improves from 26.8% to 33.9%, and on 8-objective QA from 0.158 to 0.197 EM. These results demonstrate that Acon acts as an equalizer, enabling smaller agents with concise but informative contexts to approach the performance of larger models.

### 4.5 Analysis

#### Compression threshold: moderate value yields the best trade-off.

In Figure 6, we provide ablations on threshold for compression in Equation 3 and Equation 4. Results show that smaller thresholds reduce tokens but incur more frequent compression calls and degrade accuracy, while larger thresholds preserve accuracy with higher cost. Moderate values (4096 for history, 1024 for observation) provide the best trade-off, maintaining accuracy close to no compression while still reducing peak tokens substantially.

#### Prompt optimizer: o3 + contrastive feedback works best.

We analyze how the choice of optimizer and the use of contrastive feedback affect compression guideline quality. As shown in Table 3, the default o3 with contrastive feedback yields the best performance, while removing contrastive feedback (only using failed trajectories) or switching to other models results in lower accuracy.

#### Limitation: Cost Analysis.

Acon compresses context while maintaining performance, but one limitation remains: the compressor module can introduce extra cost, and history compression can increase costs in agentic tasks. We provide cost analysis, and use an API cost metric that accounts for cheaper cached input tokens to approximate computational overhead. As shown in Figure 7, observation compression reduces cost by compressing inputs, whereas history compression rarely helps due to KV-cache overhead. Compressor distillation partly alleviates this issue by replacing expensive LLM calls with smaller models. We include detailed discussions in Appendix A.

## 5 Conclusion

We presented Agent Context Optimization (Acon), a unified framework that systematically compresses both interaction histories and environment observations for long-horizon LLM agents. Unlike prior work that relies on naive prompting or narrow domains, Acon introduces compression guideline optimization in natural language space, enabling adaptive and model-agnostic compression. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that Acon reduces peak tokens by 26-54% while maintaining or even improving task success. Beyond efficiency, we demonstrate that optimized compressors can be distilled into smaller models, substantially lowering overhead without sacrificing performance. Moreover, by supplying concise yet informative contexts, Acon allows small agents such as Qwen3-14B to approach the performance of much larger models. Overall, our findings highlight that Acon lays a foundation for more general, cost-effective, and deployable long-horizon LLM agents.

## Ethics Statement

This work investigates optimized context compression framework for long-horizon LLM agents. It does not involve human subjects, user studies, or the collection of personally identifiable information. All experiments are conducted on publicly available benchmarks released under their respective licenses, which, to the best of our knowledge, do not contain sensitive personal data.

## Reproducible Statements

We conduct all experiments using the Azure OpenAI endpoint with fixed model snapshots and seed, specifically gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 and gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14, to ensure reproducibility. Our implementation relies on PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), the Hugging Face Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020), and the TRL library for training and vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) for inference. Additional implementation details are provided in the Appendix B. We will also release our codebase to enable the research community to fully reproduce, verify, and extend our work on long-horizon LLM agents.

## Appendix A Limitations & Future Work

Our work addresses the context management problem in long-horizon LLM agents and proposes a framework for optimized context compression. While the method effectively reduces token costs with minimal performance degradation, it also presents several limitations.

A primary limitation is computational overhead. As discussed in Section 4.5, history compression can in some cases increase total cost, since additional steps may be required to complete challenging tasks with the compressed history. Moreover, it breaks the KV-cache of transformer-based LLMs, which forces re-computation of compressed histories. This effect is particularly evident in the FIFO baseline. Observation compression alleviates some of this overhead, but the generative compression procedure itself introduces latency, slowing down agent response time (Lee et al., 2025). A promising future direction is the development of KV-cache–level compression or eviction strategies. Prior work has considered KV-cache compression for single-step reasoning (Zhang et al., 2025), long documents (Xiao et al., 2024; Willette et al., 2025), and long conversations (Kim et al., 2025). However, its role in multi-turn, long-horizon agents remains underexplored.

Another limitation is model coverage. Our experiments primarily evaluate GPT models due to budgetary constraints. Although the framework is designed to be model-agnostic, its generalizability to other foundation models such as Gemini (Comanici et al., 2025) or Claude (Anthropic, 2024b) remains unverified. Similarly, we were unable to include large-scale open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) or Qwen3-235B (Yang et al., 2025) due to limited resources. Extending the analysis to these models would provide stronger evidence of robustness and broaden the applicability of our conclusions.

## Appendix B Experimental Setup Details

### B.1 Datasets

#### AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024).

AppWorld is our primary benchmark, providing a high-quality execution environment that integrates nine everyday applications (Spotify, SimpleNote, Amazon, Venmo, Gmail, Splitwise, File system, Todoist, and Phone) through 457 APIs. It also includes realistic simulations of approximately 100 functional users. This benchmark is particularly suitable for evaluating long-horizon productivity agents, as its multi-step tasks require an average of 42.5 API calls per task. We follow the official split, using 90 training tasks for guideline optimization and distillation, and 168 test-normal tasks for evaluation. An example trajectory from AppWorld is provided in Example E.

#### OfficeBench (Wang et al., 2024b).

OfficeBench is a benchmark for office automation using applications such as Word, Excel, PDF, Calendar, Email, Shell, and Calculator. It evaluates the ability of agents to coordinate across multiple apps to complete complex tasks, making it well suited for long-horizon scenarios. Tasks are categorized as 1-app, 2-app, or 3-app depending on the number of applications required. We restrict our experiments to text-related tasks, excluding those requiring OCR, as OCR quality could confound the evaluation. Since no official split is available, we randomly partition the tasks into training and test sets with a 1:1 ratio, resulting in 92 training tasks and 95 test tasks. We additionally refine the dataset by removing ambiguous tasks and ensuring that synthetic files (testbeds) are not shared across splits.

#### 8-Objective QA (Zhou et al., 2025).

The 8-objective QA benchmark simulates deep research-style agentic tasks. Unlike conventional multi-hop QA, which requires answering a single question using multiple pieces of evidence, this benchmark poses eight distinct questions within one task, and the agent must provide answers to all of them at the end. This design creates a more challenging setting for long-horizon agents. Following Zhou et al. (2025), we construct each task by grouping eight questions together. Questions are drawn from NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), resulting in 100 training tasks (from the train split) and 100 test tasks (from the test split). For retrieval, we use a BM25 retriever over the 2018 Wikipedia knowledge base, following Jin et al. (2025).

We include the example task of each benchmark in Table 4.

*Table 4: Example tasks across benchmarks.*

| Benchmark / Difficulty | Example Task |

| AppWorld |

| Easy | Mark “Taking a solo backpacking trip” in my Bucket List Simple Note as not done. |

| Medium | Like all the Venmo transactions from today involving any of my roommates on my Venmo social feed. |

| Hard | Start playing a playlist on Spotify that has enough songs for my workout today. I do not want to have to change the playlist in the middle of my workout. The workout plan is in Simple Note. |

| OfficeBench |

| 1-app | Create a new Word file called random_paragraph.docx and add the content in random_paragraph.txt to it. |

| 2-app | Analyze Excel data of students’ grade and generate a teaching report in teaching.docx. |

| 3-app | Read company revenues and send an email with subject revenues, containing data to Bob for reporting, also write a revenue.docx to summarize it. |

| 8-objective QA |

| – | who wrote the song Oceans Where Feet May Fail?; who plays Eddie the Eagle in the movie?; when was the last time England were in the final of World Cup?; who plays Chelsea’s mom on Young and the Restless?; what is the largest coin in the US?; who sang Even the Bad Times Are Good?; who sings This Is My Town country song?; which of the Guianas is not an independent country? |

### B.2 Evaluation Metrics

For efficiency evaluation, we adopt two metrics—peak tokens and dependency—introduced in LightThinker (Zhang et al., 2025) and MEM1 (Zhou et al., 2025).

#### Peak tokens.

Peak tokens are measured as the maximum number of tokens observed in any single sequence throughout the agent’s trajectory, excluding system prompts. This metric serves as a proxy for inference-time memory requirements and corresponds to the maximum peak shown in Figure 2.

#### Dependency.

Dependency is defined as the area under the curve in Figure 2. At each step $t$, given the number of input tokens $n_{i}^{(t)}$ and output tokens $n_{o}^{(t)}$, it is calculated as:

$\sum_{t\in[T]}\frac{(n_{i}^{(t)}+2n_{o}^{(t)})\times n_{o}^{(t)}}{2}.$ | | | | (11) |

This metric approximates the cumulative computational cost incurred by action generation across the trajectory.

#### API Cost.

For the cost analysis in Section 4.5, we use the official OpenAI pricing (as of September 2025) for gpt-4.1 and gpt-4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2025b). Specifically, gpt-4.1 is priced at $3.00 per 1M input tokens, $0.75 per 1M cached input tokens, and $12.00 per 1M output tokens. For gpt-4.1-mini, the costs are $0.80 per 1M input tokens, $0.20 per 1M cached input tokens, and $3.20 per 1M output tokens. For Qwen3-14B (Yang et al., 2025), since no official API pricing is available, we approximate the cost using OpenRouter : $0.06 per 1M input tokens, $0.015 per 1M cached input tokens, and $0.24 per 1M output tokens.

### B.3 Implementation Details & Hyperparameters

#### API Inference.

We set temperature 0.0 and fix the seed 42. Note that there is still non-determinism with fixing the seed and setting temperature as 0. To reduce the instability, we use the API snapshot form Azure OpenAI endpoint gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 and gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14.

#### Compression.

For history compression, we set $T_{\text{hist}}=4096$ for AppWorld and OfficeBench, and $2048$ for 8-objective QA. We keep the last action, observation pair to preserve the latest information. This is the same for Acon and all baselines. For observation compression, we set $T_{\text{obs}}=1024$ for AppWorld, $512$ for OfficeBench, and $400$ for 8-objective QA.

#### Prompt Optimization.

We use the OpenAI o3 model (OpenAI, 2025d) for both analysis and update of prompts. During the update stage, we sample 5 candidate prompts and select the one that performs best on a subset of the training set.

The prompts used in each stage and step are provided as follows:

-

Analysis prompt for $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ step: Prompt

-

Update prompt for $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ step: Prompt

-

Analysis prompt for $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ step: Prompt

-

Update prompt for $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ step: Prompt

We also provide the detailed procedure in Algorithm 1. For the subset used in prompt selection during the $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ step, we consider training tasks in ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf cont}^{(r)}$ where the agent succeeds without compression but fails with compression. For the $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$ step, we use training tasks in ${\mathcal{D}}_{\sf succ}^{(r)}$ where the agent succeeds with compression.

#### Baselines

For FIFO, we keep last 5 interaction turns which fits in similar compression rate in average with Acon. For retrieval, we also retrieve 4 interaction turns and keep the last turn. We use OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for embedding. For LLMLingua, we set keep rate as 30% for both history and observation. For naive prompting, we use the similar prompt with Lee et al. (2025) and do some human prompt engineering to specialize each prompt to history or observation compression.

#### Compressor & Agent Distillation

Both compressor and agent distillation use LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) with rank 16, $\alpha=32$, learning rate $10^{-4}$, 3 epochs, batch size 4, and maximum sequence length $10{,}000$. We adopt linear warmup ($5\%$ ratio), weight decay $0.01$, and AdamW optimizer. No hyperparameter tuning was performed; the same setup is applied across all models and benchmarks. We sample a single generation from the teacher for fine-tuning, leaving potential improvements from hyperparameter tuning or multi-sample training for future work. We use 1 A100 80GB GPU for both training and inference. For inference of fine-tuned models, we use greedy decoding (temperature 0.0).

## Appendix C Additional Results

We provide additional quantitative results to complement the main experiments in Section 4.

#### OfficeBench difficulty breakdowns.

We further analyze OfficeBench with gpt-4.1 by difficulty level. The detailed breakdown in Table 5 shows that Acon yields the largest gains on the most challenging tasks in Level 3.

#### Experiments with gpt-4.1-mini.

Results for the smaller variant gpt-4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2025b) across three benchmarks are reported in AppWorld (Table 6), OfficeBench (Table 7), and 8-objective QA (Table 8). The trends of Acon are consistent with those for gpt-4.1 in Section 4. In particular, Table 6 shows that history compression improves the performance of gpt-4.1-mini compared to the baseline, complementing the findings in Section 4.4 that Acon enhances the effectiveness of smaller LM agents. These results highlight the robustness of our method under resource-constrained settings.

#### Experiments with gpt-5-chat.

We also evaluate on AppWorld using gpt-5-chat (OpenAI, 2025c), as reported in Table 9. The improvements follow the same trend as with gpt-4.1, demonstrating that Acon generalizes to the latest stronger proprietary models.

#### Distilled optimizer.

Additional results for the distilled optimizer in AppWorld are shown in Table 10. Beyond the analysis in Section 4.3, we also include experiments where the compressor is distilled using guidelines without optimization. The results confirm that optimized guidelines consistently yield stronger performance when distilled into smaller models.

#### History and observation compression.

In Table 11, we report ablations with gpt-4.1 using both history and observation compression. While combining the two compressions achieves larger reductions in peak token usage and dependency, it also leads to substantial performance degradation compared to applying either compression alone.

#### Additional guideline optimization step.

We investigate whether running an extra utility maximization step ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$) after the standard sequence of utility maximization and compression maximization ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$) is beneficial. As shown in Table 11, this additional iteration results in a performance drop, indicating that a single round of optimization is sufficient for effective guideline learning.

#### Distilled compressor for observation.

In addition to Section 4.3, we report results for observation compressor distillation in Figure 8. Similar to history compression, the performance is largely preserved after distillation, confirming that Acon enables effective transfer of optimized observation compressors to smaller models.

#### Case study: history compression turns failure into success.

A notable case study illustrates how history compression enables a smaller agent to succeed on tasks that would otherwise fail. In the uncompressed trajectory in Example E, the gpt-4.1-mini agent repeatedly attempted to use the file_system APIs without managing authentication, leading to persistent 401 Unauthorized errors. After compressing the history as in Example E, however, the compressed history retained only the essential reasoning steps: the need for both username and password, the importance of passing the returned access_token into subsequent calls, and the absence of proxy APIs in the supervisor app.

This compressed context prevented redundant exploration and guided the agent directly to the correct sequence—login with full credentials, capture the token, and provide it explicitly in show_directory and delete_file calls. As a result, the agent was able to enumerate and remove all .pdf files in /downloads, a task it had previously failed. This example highlights how compression does not merely shorten history but clarifies critical dependencies, turning a failure trajectory into a successful one.

## Appendix D Qualitative Examples

We complement the quantitative results with qualitative illustrations.

#### Compression guidelines.

We present examples of compression guidelines before and after optimization in AppWorld. The history compression guideline before optimization is shown in Prompt , the optimized version ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$) in Prompt , and the optimized version ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$) in Prompt . Similarly, observation compression guideline examples are provided in Prompt and Prompt , and the optimized version ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$) in Prompt . These comparisons demonstrate that optimization yields more targeted guidelines for compressors.

#### Compressed histories.

Compression Example illustrates history segments before and after guideline optimization in AppWorld with gpt-4.1. The optimized guideline retains a more detailed record of task progress, including variable states and guardrails for the environment. After the compression maximization step ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$), the histories become shorter while still preserving the essential information required for future decision-making. This qualitative evidence demonstrates how our framework improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of context compression, complementing the guideline optimization procedure described in Section 3.3.

We also present Compression Example for 8-objective QA and Compression Example for OfficeBench, which confirm that the effects of guideline optimization are consistent across benchmarks.

#### Compressed observations.

Compression Example shows observations before and after guideline optimization in AppWorld. We illustrate the case of printing available APIs for the Spotify app, which produces a lengthy observation. The optimized guideline yields a more structured and faithful representation: whereas naive prompting loses the JSON format and omits the crucial “play_music” API, the optimized version preserves both structure and key functionality necessary to complete the task.

## Appendix E LLM Usage

We used large language models (LLMs) solely as a writing assistant, for improving grammar and clarity of the paper. No part of the research ideation, experimental design, or analysis relied on LLMs.

*Algorithm 1 Alternating Guideline Optimization ( $\overline{\underline{\textsc{ut}}}$ $\leftrightarrow$ $\overline{\underline{\textsc{co}}}$)*

1: Training set indices $\mathcal{I}$; fixed agent ${\mathcal{M}}(\cdot;\theta,{\mathcal{P}}_{\sf agent})$; compressor $f(\cdot;\phi,{\mathcal{P}})$; initial guideline ${\mathcal{P}}^{(0)}$; tradeoff $\lambda\!\geq\!0$; rounds $R$; candidates $K$

2: Optimized guideline ${\mathcal{P}}^{*}$

3: Notation. For each $i\in\mathcal{I}$ and guideline ${\mathcal{P}}$:

You are an expert agent trajectory auditor.

Analyze why the HISTORY-OPTIMIZED agent failed OR became significantly less efficient while the BASELINE succeeded.

You are given:

- task_name: {{ task_name }}

- Baseline full history (single continuous session)

- Optimized history split into multiple sessions where each new session starts with a fresh system + user prompt and an injected <HISTORY_SUMMARY> summarizing earlier interactions.

- baseline_success={{ baseline_success }} optimized_success={{ optimized_success }}

- baseline_env_steps={{ baseline_env_steps | default(’null’) }} optimized_env_steps={{ optimized_env_steps | default(’null’) }} step_ratio={{ step_ratio | default(’null’) }} performance_regression={{ performance_regression | default(’false’) }}

Goals:

1. Determine whether summarization / session resetting removed, distorted, delayed, or bloated reasoning causing failure OR inflated step count (> threshold factor of baseline).

2. Identify the FIRST divergence point where the optimized trajectory meaningfully deviates from the successful & efficient baseline path.

3. Categorize root causes (e.g., Missing Critical Fact, Incorrect Summary, Lost Variable/State, Unnecessary Re-discovery, Instruction Drift, API Misuse, Premature Completion, Token Truncation, Inefficient Looping, Redundant API Calls, Over-Exploration, Other).

4. Extract concrete evidence snippets (quote exact lines) from baseline vs optimized showing:

- Critical facts present in baseline but absent/altered in optimized (esp. after a session boundary)

- Summary inaccuracies (baseline ground truth vs summary text)

- Redundant or looping action patterns causing step inflation.

5. Suggest precise remediation strategies: summary style changes, retain variable/value tables, move session boundaries, guardrail prompts, caching, early-exit heuristics, loop detection, etc.

6. Provide a reliability_score (0.0-1.0) reflecting confidence in your causal attribution.

7. If performance_regression==true, analyze efficiency degradation even if optimized_success==true.

## PRIORITIZE

1. Keep all sections relevant and concise.

2. Use reusable structured formats when summarizing artifacts.

3. Ensure agent can resume task with no loss of information.

4. Include key info from errors or failed attempts to prevent repeated mistakes.

5. Preserve all essential artifacts and data needed to complete the task.

—

### [Output Format]

Do **not** include the input or any additional explanation. Only return the formatted summary.

⬇

You maintain a compact, state-preserving HISTORY_SUMMARY for a multi-session agent.

Input:

[USER INSTRUCTION] {{ task }}

[PREVIOUS SUMMARY] {{ prev_summary }}

[HISTORY OF INTERACTIONS] {{ history }}

Create the following sections-use the exact headings and order:

<HISTORY_SUMMARY>

1. REASONING

- Key progress, decisions, outcomes, and their rationale.

- Note how earlier steps influence later ones.

2. VARS

| name | value | purpose |

|——|——-|———|

Record every runtime value the next session must re-declare (tokens, ids, lists, last page_index/page_limit, etc.).

3. TODO

List pending actions with enough detail to execute directly.

4. COMPLETED

Bullet list of finished subtasks with brief results.

5. GUARDRAILS

Short reminders that prevent repeat errors, e.g.

- Memory resets; re-create VARS before use.

- Paginate until empty page.

- Validate API parameters against spec.

- Avoid redundant logins or doc look-ups.

Requirements:

- Be concise-bullets and tables preferred; no extraneous prose.

- Preserve all essential facts, parameters, and artifacts; omit nothing critical.

- Include errors only if they inform future avoidance.

- Do not output the input or any commentary-return only <HISTORY_SUMMARY>.

Summary Compression Rules:

- Collapse multi-bullet narratives into <=2 concise sentences.

- Replace repetitive step logs with one summarizing phrase.

- Truncate long token/credential strings to "<token>" unless verbatim reuse is required.

- Remove unused/expired credentials, page_index/page_limit, verbose API dumps, and table borders.

- Shrink GUARDRAILS to one bullet unless multiple items are still critical.

- Delete tool/API log output, greetings, meta prose, and section headers that no longer contain content.

- Keep only variables actively referenced in upcoming steps; list each once in VARS.

- Reference removal categories [repetition], [tool-logs], [meta], [formatting] to prune similar lines.

- Preserve factual continuity; never invent or alter state variables.

- Target summaries well under {{ max_chars | default(1500) }} characters.

Critical Essentials:

Always keep evidence-driven items required next session (e.g., tokens, ids, emails, amounts, lists, paths, description strings, brief task status).

Output EXACTLY the following structure—nothing more:

<HISTORY_SUMMARY>

1. REASONING

One brief paragraph on key progress and rationale.

2. VARS

key=value pairs, comma-separated; only still-needed runtime values.

3. TODO

Bulleted next actions (<=5).

4. COMPLETED

Bulleted finished subtasks (<=5).

5. GUARDRAILS

Single concise bullet, or omit if none.

Return only the <HISTORY_SUMMARY> block—no additional commentary or input echoes.

Your task is to generate a "Reasoning" and a "Refined Observation" based on the inputs below.

In the "Reasoning", analyze the user instruction and history to identify what information from the current observation is necessary to complete the remaining steps.

Think about what parts can be summarized or transformed to reduce length, while ensuring that future actions can still be executed based on the refined observation alone.

In the "Refined Observation", include only the information that is minimal but sufficient for the next steps.

⬇

Your task: write two sections—"Reasoning" and "Refined Observation".

1. Reasoning

- Examine task, history, and observation.

- Decide exactly which parts of the observation must be kept so the next agent step can succeed.

- Note any need to paginate (page_limit default = 5, page_index).

- Justify any data you drop.

2. Refined Observation

- Contain only the minimal yet sufficient info for the next step.

- Always preserve:

- Every endpoint that may be called, plus its full parameter list and defaults (especially page_limit/page_index, auth tokens).

- Response-schema fields referenced or likely needed later (e.g., play_count, release_date, like_count, position, ids).

- Raw data rows required for future comparisons or loops; if summarising, keep at least all positive-match examples.

- Never:

- Omit defaults that affect behaviour.

- Declare parameters "not critical" without proof.

- Hallucinate endpoints or fields.

- Replace machine-readable data with vague prose.

Your task: create two sections—"Reasoning" and "Refined Observation".

1. Reasoning (<=40 words)

- Briefly state what was kept and why; note dropped categories and any pagination needs.

2. Refined Observation (use ONLY the current observation)

- Keep strictly necessary data for the next step.

- Always preserve, when present:

- access_token or other auth values

- page_limit, page_index and other defaults that affect calls

- every endpoint name; include parameters only if required; description <= 4 words

- identifiers/fields needed for comparisons, loops, or API calls (ids, titles, counts, paths, etc.)

- Minimise length:

- Delete unused fields and narrative text.

- Compress JSON/arrays (one object per line, no extra spaces).

- Summarise long uniform lists with a range/pattern when individual rows are not needed.

- Never invent, alter, or omit a required literal.

task: I got some Splitwise group invitations over phone text messages yesterday.

If their number is in my phone contact book, accept it, otherwise delete those messages.

—————————————-

History Compression (Prompting baseline):

### REASONING

The agent began by identifying relevant apps for handling text messages and Splitwise invitations, then explored the phone app’s APIs to manage messages and contacts. To search for Splitwise group invitations received via text message, the agent determined it needed to log in to the phone app to obtain an access token. Using credentials from the supervisor app, the agent successfully logged in and retrieved the access token. The agent then calculated yesterday’s date range and searched for text messages containing "Splitwise," retrieving a list of messages. The rationale for retaining message details (sender name, phone number, contact_id, message content, sent_at) is to enable the next step: checking if the sender’s number is in the contact book, so the agent can accept or delete invitations as instructed. Earlier steps (API exploration, login, date calculation) directly enabled the message search and data extraction.

### COMPLETED

- Identified relevant apps and APIs for the task.

- Successfully logged in to the phone app and obtained access token.

- Calculated yesterday’s date range.

- Searched and retrieved text messages mentioning "Splitwise" from yesterday and beyond, including sender details and message content.

—————————————-

History Compression (ACON (utility step)):

1. REASONING

- Identified "phone" app for managing text messages and contacts.

- Retrieved API docs to find endpoints for searching messages and contacts.

- Determined yesterday’s date (May 17, 2023) for filtering relevant messages.

- Checked "search_text_messages" API spec for required parameters.

- Used supervisor app to obtain phone app password.

- Logged in to phone app to get access_token.

- Searched for messages containing "Splitwise" with page_limit=20, sorted by -created_at.

- Located Splitwise group invitation messages; sender contact_id used to determine if sender is in contact book.

2. VARS

3. TODO

- For each Splitwise invitation message from 2023-05-17:

- Check if sender’s phone number exists in contact book (search_contacts API).

- If in contact book, accept invitation (Splitwise API, if needed).

- If not in contact book, delete the message (delete_text_message API).

- Paginate search_text_messages if more relevant messages may exist.

4. COMPLETED

- Identified relevant apps and APIs for task.

- Retrieved phone app password from supervisor.

- Logged in to phone app and obtained access_token.

- Searched and filtered text messages for Splitwise invitations on target date.

- Isolated relevant message IDs and sender info for next steps.

5. GUARDRAILS

- Always re-declare VARS after memory reset.

- Paginate message search until no more results.

- Validate API parameters before each call.

- Avoid redundant logins and API doc look-ups.

- Only act on messages matching both query and target date.

—————————————-

History Compression (ACON (utility step + compression step)):

1. REASONING

I identified voice messages from the day before yesterday (2023-05-16) containing Splitwise group invitations. To follow instructions, I need to check if the senders’ phone numbers are in Sierra’s contact book before accepting or deleting these messages.

2. VARS

3. TODO

- Search Sierra’s contact book for sender_numbers.

- Accept Splitwise invitations from contacts found.

- Delete voice messages from non-contacts.

4. COMPLETED

- Logged in to phone app and obtained access_token.

- Retrieved voice messages from 2023-05-16.

- Identified Splitwise invitation messages and sender numbers.

5. GUARDRAILS

Only process Splitwise invitations from contacts; delete others.

task: when was the last time the dodgers played yankees in the world series?; where will be the next olympics be held?; who is tinker air force base named after?; who does the voice of cruz on cars 3?; who’s the original singer of help me make it through the night?; where does the movie mothers day take place?; what is the big gold dome in jerusalem?; when did russia join the world economic forum?

—————————————-

History Compression (Prompting baseline):

### REASONING

The agent began by addressing the user’s multi-part query, starting with "when was the last time the Dodgers played Yankees in the World Series?" Through Wikipedia searches, the agent identified 1981 as the most recent World Series meeting between the Dodgers and Yankees. This answer was retained due to clear evidence in the retrieved documents. The agent then attempted to answer "where will be the next Olympics be held?" but initial searches returned irrelevant or outdated results (e.g., Amsterdam 1928, Buenos Aires 2018). Recognizing the lack of direct answers, the agent refined its search queries multiple times, but still did not retrieve the current location for the next Olympics. The agent’s iterative approach demonstrates a commitment to accuracy and highlights the need to adjust search strategies when initial attempts fail. Retaining details of failed searches helps prevent repeated mistakes and guides future queries.

### COMPLETED

- Identified the last time the Dodgers played the Yankees in the World Series: 1981.

—————————————-

History Compression (ACON (utility step)):

### REASONING

- Used Wikipedia search for each question; refined Olympics query after initial results lacked direct info.

- Collapsed repeated/irrelevant Olympic bid results; focused on confirmed host city.

- For Tinker AFB, confirmed name origin from first document.

### COMPLETED

- Last Dodgers vs Yankees World Series: 1955 (source: "1955 World Series")

- Next Olympics location: Paris, 2024 (source: "Budapest bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics")

- Tinker Air Force Base named after Major General Clarence L. Tinker (source: "Tinker Air Force Base")

### STATE LOG

FACT CACHE:

- When was the last time the Dodgers played Yankees in the World Series? -> 1955 ("1955 World Series")

- Where will the next Olympics be held? -> Paris, 2024 ("Budapest bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics")

- Who is Tinker Air Force Base named after? -> Major General Clarence L. Tinker ("Tinker Air Force Base")

PENDING:

- Who does the voice of Cruz on Cars 3?

- Who is the original singer of "Help Me Make It Through the Night"?

- Where does the movie "Mother’s Day" take place?

- What is the big gold dome in Jerusalem?

- When did Russia join the World Economic Forum?

ATTEMPTED QUERIES / LOOP GUARD:

- "Dodgers Yankees World Series history" OK

- "next Olympics location" FAIL (no direct info)

- "2024 Olympics location" OK

- "Tinker Air Force Base name origin" OK

- "next Olympics location" tried twice (loop guard: must reformulate/abandon)

ERROR NOTES:

None

(End of summary - no extra text)

—————————————-

History Compression (ACON (utility step + compression step)):

### FACT CACHE

- When was the last time the Dodgers played Yankees in the World Series? -> 1956

### PENDING

task: read company revenues, save the top 2 revenue years in top2.xlsx, generate reports.docx

—————————————-

History Compression (Prompting baseline):

### REASONING

The agent began by identifying the relevant data file (company_revenues.xlsx) containing company revenue information. After reading the file, the agent determined the top 2 revenue years: 2014 ($4,983,791) and 2015 ($4,611,210). The agent then created a new Excel file (top2.xlsx) and started populating it with the required data, first adding headers ("Year", "Revenue ($)") and then entering the first top year (2014) in the second row, first column. The rationale for retaining row and column indices, file paths, and the top 2 years is to ensure accurate and complete transfer of data and to facilitate the next steps (completing the top2.xlsx file and generating reports.docx).

### COMPLETED

- Located and read company_revenues.xlsx.

- Identified top 2 revenue years: 2014 ($4,983,791), 2015 ($4,611,210).

- Created top2.xlsx and added headers ("Year", "Revenue ($)").

- Entered "2014" in (2, 1) of top2.xlsx.

—————————————-

History Compression (ACON (utility step)):

### REASONING

- Located company revenue data in company_revenues.xlsx.

- Read all rows; identified top 2 revenue years: 2014 ($4,983,791) and 2015 ($4,611,210).

- Created top2.xlsx and began writing header and first top year.

- Each numeric value was copied verbatim from source.

- No errors or mismatches so far; headers and first year written successfully.

- Pending: finish writing revenue for 2014, add 2015 row, then generate reports.docx.

Verify numeric values directly from source file before use.
